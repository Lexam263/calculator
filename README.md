# calculator
Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I created this calculator to complete my assigment for the Odin Project. I have learned a gread deal doing this project and hope to refine it in the future. In addition to the basic mathmatic operators, the calculator is able to store a number in memory, undo errors and clear the screen. Testing the program to the fullest of my abilities I believe I have eliminated any chance to throw an error.
